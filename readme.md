# The spinning Pomodoro Timer, first personal project

>You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round <br>
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round

### What does it do:

Basically, when the button "START" is pressed, it triggers 4 sets of timers consisting of 30 second of working time and 12 seconds of pause (except for the last set, having just 30 seconds of working time and no pause). In every working time, the pomodoro gradually spins, simulating a kitchen timer.

### Goals:
- Get a grasp of how `setInterval()` and `setTimeout()` works ✅ <small>(kind of)</small>;
- Create a basic Pomodoro Timer ✅;
- Use the pomdoro img as a Timer Traker, rotating every second ✅;
- Add sounds ✅;
- Add wiggly buttons ✅;
- Add some phrases in the DOM signaling when the pause starts, when it ends, the number of sets etc;
- Add a "pause" button;
- Add a counter in the DOM showing how much time is left;
- Add the possibility to let the user choose the working time and pause duration;
- Divide the main function in smaller ones, if possible;
- Add sort of a clock-face around the pomodoro, making more clear how much time is left.
